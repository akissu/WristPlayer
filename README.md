# WristPlayer WatchOS 7.x

WristPlayer is a basic YouTube application for Apple Watch. Search, play, control and listen to YouTube videos right on your Apple Watch.

~~Note: An iPhone, while not physically used, is still needed nearby.~~

The intention of this fork is to:
- Update it to WatchOS 7+
- Remove dependencies on iOS libraries
- Remove the iOS app entirely, making it a standalone WatchOS app
- Add an audio-only option
- Add preview images, summaries, sign-in, and recommendations
- Explore streaming options

# Installation

 Clone this repostory and install WristPlayer with Xcode
 
 Additionally:
 - Provide your own Youtube API key
 - Provide your own youtube-dl server details
 - Sign the application with your own certificate
